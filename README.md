# Scan-and-Rename-PDF
While working with a huge number of documents, I decided to automate this process.

The task is to name the file by the name that is in the file. Also in the file there is a number attached to the name. If we know the number, we will know the name.

Therefore, I created a program that scans a document for the presence of a number, and if the number matches the database number, then the file gets the correct name automatically
