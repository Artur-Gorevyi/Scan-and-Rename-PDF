# Issue:
There are a large number of documents that need to be scanned through the printer and get a PDF for each.
Then go into each document and rename it with the name that is in the document. 

# Solution:
In the file, there is a number attached to the name. If we know the number, we will know the name. The program uses Tesseract OCR to scan the PDF document and find that number. If we find the number, we compare it to the database and rename our PDF with the name attached to the number we found.

# Renamer

After starting the program, we see a window in which there are 2 buttons.

As we can see, the conversion button is not active because there is nothing to convert yet
